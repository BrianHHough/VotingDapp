# Voting Dapp

## GitHub Version

Once front-end is configured in `/src`, the app will display "Loading" until it detects a web3 instance is running.

## To start this, launch a truffle instance...

`npx truffle init`
\*\* when prompted with `Overwrite contracts?`, say `Y`
\*\* This creates a `truffle-config.js` file and a `/contracts/Migrations.sol` folder/file and a `/migrations/1_initial_migration.js` folder/file.

`truffle develop`

\*\* if you don't already have this, you can install truffle with this command: `npm install -g truffle`. The official Truffle Suite documentation and installation is here: http://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation

Then we need to compile the smart contract:

`migrate --reset`

\*\* You may need to update the `truffle-config.js` file to define the right version of Solidity. For this example, we are using Solidity 0.5.2. So we must also define it in the config file of truffle as well. If you ever want to list the available compiler versions, run this: `truffle compile --list`

```js
development: {
     host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
     port: 8545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
     network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },

compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.5.2",
    ...
```

## Run ganache-cli to get your local blockchain running

`ganache-cli`

## Migrat your contracts in another terminal to your local blockchain ganache instance

`truffle migrate --reset --compile-all`

## Once contracts deployed to dev network, run your tests:

`truffle test`

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
